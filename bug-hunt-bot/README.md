# Bug Hunt Bot

Telegram Bot that reminds me about my bugs 
(see [HammerTime](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/qRxTKm7DAftSuTGvj)).

Personalized for my use case, but write me to Telegram 
if you want to use in your bug hunts.

## Running bot

Docker used to run bot.
DockerHub used to deploy bot.
Deployment and needed tokens described in `docker_run.sh`.
